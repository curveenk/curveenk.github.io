# Click Timer ⏱️

A simple web page that measures the time between two mouse clicks.

## Features

The calculation works like this:

If Button A was hovered: time from Button 1 click to Button A hover
If Button B was hovered after A: time between A hover and B hover
If Button C was hovered after B: time between B hover and C hover
The average of all these intervals is displayed in the "Avg Hover" column
If no buttons were hovered, it shows "—".

## Local Testing

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support ES6 JavaScript.
